# Caerulean for Standard Notes
A dark theme with cyan highlights for [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/). Originally forked from [Horizon Dark](https://github.com/luisstd/sn-theme-horizon-dark), but spun as a separate theme. Give that theme a try, it's one of the best I've personally seen for Standard Notes!

## Features
> It's a theme, why is there a features section?

* Scrollbars are hidden as they personally clash with all themes in SN.
